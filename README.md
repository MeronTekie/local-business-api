* To create the database please do as follows:

  * First create a file using the *touch* command in your command line, at the root of the project directory called "appsettings.json" and in that file add the following code, but substituting the text in the brackets for your own information. 

  ```
      { 
        "ConnectionStrings": { 
          "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[your_database];uid=[Your ID];pwd=[Your Password];" 
        }

    * ```dotnet restore```
    * ```dotnet build```
    * ```dotnet ef migrations add Initial```
* Once we have verified that the migration looks correct and made any necessary changes, we'll run the following commands: 
    * ```dotnet ef database update```
    * ```dotnet run```

* To interact with the local host website navigate to the project directory and run ```dotnet run```or ```dotnet watch run```
* Click on  <http://localhost:5001/> and you will be directed to the Swagger UI which is very user friendly and easy to walk through.
