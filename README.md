## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup/Installation Requirements

- First, make sure you have MySql Workbench downloaded and properly installed. You will also need a text editor(Vscode Highly recommended) and a command-line

- In your command line navigate to your desktop directory and clone this project <https://github.com/MeronTekie/local-business-api.git>
- Open the project in your preferred text editor, we recommend VSCode.
- In the root directory, confirm there is a .gitignore file

- Make sure to ignore sensitive data/file so they do not get pushed to remote repository
- Add:

  ```
  */obj/
  */bin/
  */appsettings.json
  ```

- Create an appsetting.json file at the root directory
- Open the appsetting.json file and enter:

- To create the database please do as follows:

  - First create a file  at the root of the project directory called "appsettings.json" and  add the following code to connect your project to the  local database, 

  ```
      {
        "ConnectionStrings": {
          "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[your_database];uid=[Your ID];pwd=[Your Password];"
        }
      }
  ```

- Make sure the following packages are restored or type the following in the Project directory.
  - `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore -v 5.0.0`
  - `dotnet add package Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql -v 5.0.0-alpha.2`
  - `dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Proxies -v 5.0.0`
  - `dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore -v 5.0.0`
- Then do the following accordingly in your terminal to update and connect your project to your local database :
  - `dotnet restore`
  - `dotnet build`
  - `dotnet ef migrations add Initial`
- Once we have verified that the migration looks correct and made any necessary changes, we'll run the following commands:

  - `dotnet ef database update`
  - `dotnet run`
- The above code  will create a new database in your local host  with tables designed to store information related to the project.

- To interact with the local host website navigate to the project directory and run `dotnet run`or `dotnet watch run`
- Click on <http://localhost:5001/> and you will be directed to the Swagger UI which is very user friendly and easy to walk through.
- The image below is the expected page when you run it on your local browser.
